  The man challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership is virtually
  unknown outside Westminster. So who is Owen Smith? We know who he wants to be.
  The great unifier. A political miracle worker who can unite Labour's warring
  factions to win a general election many in the party think will happen sooner
  rather than later, whatever the new prime minister says.
