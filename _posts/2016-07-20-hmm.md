  candidates in favour of the EU and immigration at the next election is being
  set up by politicians, celebrities and intellectuals. The initiative has the
  support of Jonathon Porritt, the environmentalist, Caroline Criado-Perez, the
  feminist writer and Luke Pritchard from the band Kooks, as a space for people
