  I know absolutely nothing about the show Mr. Robot, but I'm told that Elliot
  gave a powerful speech about God during last night's episode (titled
  "eps2.1k3rnel-pan1c.ksd"). If you want context, look in the comments, where
  I'm sure helpful people will provide it. I don't know what's going on.
