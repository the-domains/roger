            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Owen Smith story - BBC News</h1><p>The man challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership is virtually unknown outside Westminster. So who is Owen Smith? We know who he wants to be. The great unifier. A political miracle worker who can unite Labour's warring factions to win a general election many in the party think will happen sooner rather than later, whatever the new prime minister says.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/58c51cd7137adfcb5785e76b589da941/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fichef-1.bbci.co.uk%2Fnews%2F1024%2Fcpsprodpb%2F4640%2Fproduction%2F_90448971_owensmith3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Trying To Make Sense of The Grid</h1><p>I must confess to some degree of befuddlement about The Grid. I'm struggling to understand what to expect when I create a new post. Also the delay in background processing can be confusing especially working with the iOS app.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52fe51cf-43c6-433b-b19e-09088d0d075c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>UK economy must endure 'short, sharp shock' after Brexit vote</h1><p>The UK economy will have to weather a short, sharp shock, with Brexit uncertainty holding back both business investment and consumer spending, according to a leading economic forecasting group. As forecasters cut growth expectations, a survey of finance chiefs showed caution increasing since the referendum, and retailers reported fewer shoppers on the high street than a year ago.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e5207422dfd668575d31a7861ffdc8ff/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2F3c539d594a97bcccfc69212800a809b8a5b4b6fc%2F0_0_3684_2210%2F3684.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3Da3c33d8044339af1b33d41d086a432dc"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The fragile UK economy has a chance to abandon failed policies post-Brexit</h1><p>Almost four weeks have passed since Britain voted to leave the EU and those who wanted to remain in it are having trouble accepting the result. They feel bereft. They feel that they were defeated by underhand means. They feel that those who voted for Brexit were uneducated and didn't really understand what they were doing.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/960de78024da474d1e8dc2fa06ca8496/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2F1e3d2c195af99b2e54fcde440542a50e996dbbb8%2F0_373_3000_1800%2F3000.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3D3f265b6ff56ebad135e964b036045fa8"></article>]]></description>
