As forecasters cut growth expectations, a survey of finance chiefs showed caution increasing since the referendum, and retailers reported fewer shoppers on the high street than a year ago.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e5207422dfd668575d31a7861ffdc8ff/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2F3c539d594a97bcccfc69212800a809b8a5b4b6fc%2F0_0_3684_2210%2F3684.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3Da3c33d8044339af1b33d41d086a432dc"></article>]]></description>
